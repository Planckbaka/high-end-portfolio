The digital landscape is on the brink of a revolutionary shift. As spatial computing technologies mature and Artificial Intelligence becomes more deeply integrated into our daily workflows, the traditional screen-based interface is being reimagined.

## Beyond the Screen

Spatial computing frees us from the constraints of 2D displays. It allows digital content to coexist with the physical world, creating immersive experiences that are more intuitive and engaging. Imagine manipulating data with your hands or walking through a 3D model of a building before it's even constructed.

## AI as a Collaborator

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a tool; it's becoming a collaborator. Generative AI can help designers iterate faster, developers write cleaner code, and users find information more efficiently. The challenge lies in designing interfaces that facilitate this collaboration seamlessly.

As we move forward, the focus must remain on human-centric design. Technology should enhance our capabilities, not replace them. The future of digital interfaces is not just about pixels and code; it's about creating meaningful connections between people and the digital world.

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how you might implement a spatial interface:

```typescript
const spatialInterface = {
  position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  rotation: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
  scale: 1.0
};
```

## Conclusion

The future is bright, and the possibilities are endless. Let's build something amazing together!
